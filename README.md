# MoistMeasure
MF1001 Högskolearbete
The goal of this project is to construct a smart moisture measuring contraption that helps the consumer take care of
their plants by supplying them with constant information regarding the moisture levels in their plants. 
To achieve this, a moisture sensor will be connected to an arduino which is connected to the internet. 
The arduino receives all the data that’s registered by the sensor, converts it to a value of humidity which is
then uploaded and illustrated through a graph on a web page.
